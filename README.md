# Cryptocurrencies
Unsupervised Machine Learning

## Background

#### 1- Cryptocurency
Created first in 2009, Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC) has become a revolutionary digital currency as it enables peer-to-peer payments without a third party such as a bank. Build based on Blockchain technology, a digital public ledger (or a record-keeping system that maintains participants' identities in secure and (pseudo-)anonymous form information on each transaction) receives a unique "hash" (or identity) and is added to the end of the ledger. 

#### 2- A myriad of different cryptocurrencies
Blockchain technology is an open source technology, meaning any software developer can use the original source code and create something new. Developers have done just that. It is estimated to be more than 4,500 different cryptocurrencies to date, and the figure keeps increasing. In 2017, the number of cryptos surpassed 1,000 (1).  

## Purpose of the Analysis

We are creating an analysis for a clients who is preparing to get into the cryptocurrency market. This client is a senior manager for the Advisory Services Team at Accountability Accounting. Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. So, they have asked us to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

The data we will be working with with is not ideal, so it will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output for what we are looking for, we would use unsupervised learning. To group the cryptocurrencies, we will employ cluster algorithm. Finally we would use data visualizations to share our findings with the board.

## What You're Creating
This new assignment consists of four technical analysis, as follows:

        1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA
        2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
        3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
        4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results


### Preprocessing the Data for PCA



### Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA



### Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means


### Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results




## Recommendations
The yellow outlier "BitTorrent" could be removed from dataset as its row contains only one. 
The bulk of remaining cryptocurrencies and outliers need to be examined further by a financial expert for the kind of cryptocurrency and their function in the financial market (coin vs token).
