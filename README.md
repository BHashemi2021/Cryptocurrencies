# Cryptocurrencies
Unsupervised Machine Learning

## Background

We are creating an analysis for our clients who are preparing to get into the cryptocurrency market.

One of our most important clients is a senior manager for the Advisory Services Team at Accountability Accounting. Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. So, they have asked us to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

The data we will be working with with is not ideal, so it will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output for what we are looking for, we would use unsupervised learning. To group the cryptocurrencies, we will employ cluster algorithm. Finally we would use data visualizations to share our findings with the board.

## What You're Creating
This new assignment consists of four technical analysis, as follows:

        1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA
        2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
        3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
        4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results

## Recommendations
The yellow outlier "BitTorrent" needs to be removed from dataset.
The outliers need to be excluded from the dataset as they are products of other practices built through blockchain processes.
